     # Easy YT-DLP: Your Automated Music Downloader

A smart and simple command-line tool to automate downloading your favorite music from YouTube. This script reads a list of URLs from a `music.txt` file, downloads them in the best audio quality, and organizes them neatly into monthly folders in your main Music directory.

## üöÄ Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

-   **`bash`**: The script is designed to run in a Bash environment (standard on most Linux distributions and macOS).
-   **`wget`**: Used for auto-downloading yt-dlp if not present. (Pre-installed on most Linux/macOS, or install via `brew install wget` on macOS.)

**No need to manually install `yt-dlp`!**

If `yt-dlp` is not found, the script will automatically download the latest version and use it locally. If you want to install it system-wide, you still can:

```bash
# Using pip (optional)
pip install -U yt-dlp
```


### Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Supernova70/easy-yt-dlp.git
    cd easy-yt-dlp
    ```

2.  **Create your music list:**
    Create a file named `music.txt` in the same directory. Add your YouTube URLs to this file, one link per line. You can also add comments by starting a line with `#`.

    **Example `music.txt`:**
    ```
    # My Favorite Songs
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG78z9PFGaw
    http://youtube.com/watch?v=tNc2coVC2aw

    # A playlist link
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG4Rq192WW0&list=PLPq6buArjiP4dw60xBU1R3u9WUd0COfHF
    ```

3.  **Make the script executable:**
    You only need to do this once.
    ```bash
    chmod +x music.sh
    ```

4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./music.sh
    ```

The script will then process each link, download the audio, and save it to the appropriate monthly folder in your `~/Music` directory.
